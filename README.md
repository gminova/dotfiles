## vim and system clipboard
1. install vim-gtk3 package:
```bash
sudo apt-get install vim-gtk3
```
You can access the clipboard via register +,
so when you want to copy something (ie visual selection) "+y will 'yank' it to the clipboard.
Similarly if you want to paste "+p should paste from clipboard to vim.
